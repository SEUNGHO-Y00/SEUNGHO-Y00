# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Seungho Yoo | Security Engineer

## ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a cybersecurity engineer and U.S. Army warrant officer with over 7 years of experience protecting high-stakes networks in both government and commercial environments. Currently, I work as a Product Security Analyst at Boeing, where I specialize in vulnerability analysis, threat detection, and compliance implementation for large-scale, secure systems. In parallel, I lead cyber defense operations for the DoD as a warrant officer, where Iâ€™ve been responsible for securing mission-critical networks, performing forensic analysis, leading system administration tasks, and guiding incident response under classified conditions.

What sets me apart is my ability to operate at the intersection of detection engineering, operational security, and team leadership. Iâ€™ve built automated detection and compliance workflows, worked with cross-functional teams to reduce false positives in alerting systems, and led root cause analysis efforts to strengthen threat posture across cloud and on-prem environments. Iâ€™m deeply familiar with the detection lifecycleâ€”everything from direction and collection to dissemination and tuningâ€”and I thrive in ambiguous, high-tempo environments where security must scale fast and never fail.
